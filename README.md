WhatsApp ‚Üí PDF Question Generator

Project Goal:
A tool that allows users to forward a batch of WhatsApp messages (text or image) to a WhatsApp bot. After the user indicates they are done, the system uses Gemini LLM to extract questions, generates a styled multi-page PDF (one question per page), then sends the PDF back via WhatsApp.

üöÄ Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	WhatsApp API: Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox
	‚Ä¢	Hosting / Webhook: Vercel Edge Function (Node.js)
	‚Ä¢	Data Storage: Firebase Realtime Database (sessions/messages)
	‚Ä¢	PDF Generation: PDFKit (Node.js)
	‚Ä¢	AI Parsing: Google Gemini Vision API
	‚Ä¢	File Storage: Firebase Storage (public PDFs)
	‚Ä¢	Messaging: Twilio Node SDK for media messages
	‚Ä¢	Environment: Node.js ESM, environment variables via Vercel

‚∏ª

üìã High-Level Workflow
	1.	User joins the Twilio sandbox and sends messages to the sandbox number.
	2.	Webhook (Vercel) receives each incoming POST from Twilio:
	‚Ä¢	Parses both JSON and form-encoded payloads.
	‚Ä¢	Extracts From, Body or MediaUrl.
	‚Ä¢	Saves each message under sessions/{phone}/messages in Firebase RTDB.
	3.	User sends done when all questions are forwarded.
	4.	Batch Processor (processBatchFor):
	‚Ä¢	Fetches all messages for that user from Firebase.
	‚Ä¢	Calls Gemini Vision API to extract structured questions.
	‚Ä¢	Generates a PDF (1 question per page) using PDFKit.
	‚Ä¢	Uploads the PDF to Firebase Storage (pdfs/{phone}.pdf).
	‚Ä¢	Sends the PDF back via WhatsApp (Twilio).
	‚Ä¢	Cleans up the user session in Firebase.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Completed Steps
	‚Ä¢	Twilio Sandbox configured (sandbox number, join code).
	‚Ä¢	Vercel project created with /api/webhook.js route.
	‚Ä¢	Webhook parsing logic implemented (raw-body + querystring).
	‚Ä¢	Firebase Admin initialized via environment variable for service account.
	‚Ä¢	Message storage in Firebase RTDB verified (text/image).
	‚Ä¢	Environment variables set in Vercel and .env.local:
	‚Ä¢	FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
	‚Ä¢	TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER
	‚Ä¢	GEMINI_API_KEY

‚∏ª

üîé Current State / Issues
	‚Ä¢	Full api/webhook.js includes both storage and processBatchFor logic.
	‚Ä¢	Sending done does not trigger the batch-processing logs or PDF generation.
	‚Ä¢	Likely cause: Twilio not forwarding the done message to the webhook, or webhook URL misconfiguration.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps
	1.	Verify webhook invocation for done messages:
	‚Ä¢	Use curl to POST a form-encoded Body=done payload.
	‚Ä¢	Inspect Vercel Function logs (rocket log).
	‚Ä¢	Check Twilio Messaging Logs ‚Üí Request Inspector.
	2.	Fix Twilio webhook URL or sandbox settings if Twilio isn‚Äôt calling the endpoint.
	3.	Test processBatchFor end-to-end locally via vercel dev.
	4.	Handle edge cases:
	‚Ä¢	Errors from Gemini or storage.
	‚Ä¢	User notifications on long processing.
	5.	Polish PDF template:
	‚Ä¢	Final styling (fonts, headers, footers).
	‚Ä¢	Custom branding option.
	6.	Production rollout:
	‚Ä¢	Migrate from sandbox to official WhatsApp Business API.
	‚Ä¢	Add rate limiting, retry logic, and persistent queue (e.g. Pub/Sub).
